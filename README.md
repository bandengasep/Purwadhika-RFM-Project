Contoso offers a diverse selection to meet the needs and preferences of its broad customer base. Whether you're looking for the latest gadgets, stylish clothing, or everyday essentials, Contoso has everything for everyone

## Problem Statement

Contoso aims to enhance its marketing strategies and improve customer retention by gaining a deeper understanding of its customer base in UK.Â 

To achieve this, the stakeholders at Contoso want to perform an **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis**. This analysis will allow Contoso to tailor its marketing efforts more closely to its customers and provide more personalized experiences.

## Objective of Analysis

1. **Enhance Marketing Strategies**: Utilize the insights gained from the RFM analysis to refine and enhance Contoso's marketing strategies, ensuring they are more targeted and effective.
2. **Improve Customer Loyalty**: Identify key customer segments that could potentially be upgraded to higher tier of loyalty
3. **Provide Actionable Insights**: Generate actionable insights that can help Contoso make data-driven decisions to optimize overall business performance and customer satisfaction.

To achieve these objectives, we shall analyze (our dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/code/ekrembayar/rfm-analysis-online-retail-ii/input?select=online_retail_II.xlsx] of customer invoices from 2009 to 2011 using analytical `Python` packages such as `Pandas` and `Seaborn` to conduct our RFM analysis.
